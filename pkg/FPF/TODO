Upgrade plan:
0. Visualize new constraint on toy example data.
1 - exp(-abs(mu) * n * h(A,B,C))

Constraint properties:
- Vanishes as A OR B grow
- Vanishes as C is close to A OR B. 
- Invariant to C (except through its difference to A OR B).
- Less stringent as And B differ from C.


1. Change constraint. 
New constraint: 1-exp( -abs(mu)* sqrt(n/(A+B)) * (1-max( min(A/C,C/A), min(B/C,C/B))) )
* Change p3Bound.
* Change constrained optimization in pointWise3MixtureFitFast()



2. Update accompanying data files:
3. Update paper: figures ##, discussion in sections ##
